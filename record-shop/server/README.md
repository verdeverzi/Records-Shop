# Building database can be done without even setting the routes

This is good to know, because it'll help you to think on your problem in separation

Task 1:

- add to the seed/seed_db.js file and seed in 20 users. (based on record but with user information).

Task 2:

- make a brand new react app (seperate from this application)
- make a user login based on email and password verification.
- if the login works, redirect to a home screen (not fancy just a h1 with home init)
